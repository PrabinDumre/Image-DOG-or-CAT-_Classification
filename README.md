# Cat-Dog Image Classification with Deep Learning

Welcome to the Cat-Dog Image Classification project! This project explores the fascinating world of image classification using deep learning techniques. The goal is to train a neural network to distinguish between images of cats and dogs.

## Overview

In this project, we utilize Python, Keras, and TensorFlow to build and train a neural network. The dataset consists of 25,000 images, with labels indicating whether each image is a cat or a dog. The project is structured as follows:

1. **Data Exploration:** We begin by exploring the dataset, visualizing sample images, and understanding the distribution of labels.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets. Images are resized to a consistent 32x32 resolution to facilitate model training.

3. **Model Architecture:** We design a neural network using Keras, consisting of input layers, hidden layers, and output layers. The model is compiled and trained using the training data.

4. **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained over multiple epochs, and its performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics. Both training and validation datasets are used for comprehensive evaluation.

5. **Model Prediction:** The trained model is then used to predict the labels of sample images from the test dataset, demonstrating its real-world applicability.


## Results
